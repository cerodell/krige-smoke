# # Ordinary Kriging (OK)

# - Ordinary Kriging (OK) is a commonly used geostatistical method.
# - OK provides the best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE), where the estimated value for the point of interest is a weighted linear combination of sampled observations (i.e., the sum of weights is 1) [Matheron1963](http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.58.8.1246).
# - OK is similar to but more advanced than Inverse distance weighting, as the weight ùúÜùëñ of OK is estimated by minimizing the variance of the prediction errors.
#   - This is achieved by constructing a semivariogram that models the difference between neighboring values.
# - Compared to non-geostatistical algorithms, the strength of ordinary kriging is its ability to model the spatial structure (variance) of the sampled observations.
# - An assumption of ordinary kriging is data stationarity. That is, the mean of the interpolated variable is constant within the search window, which is often not true. This makes OK unsuitable for interpolation over large domains and often requires data transformation.

# ### Create Grid
# Here, we will create a grid we want to use for the interpolation.
# NOTE we will use salem to create a dataset with the grid. This grid as a xarray dataset will be helpful for the universal kriging when we reproject other gridded data to act as covariances for interpolation.
# %%
## define the desired grid resolution in meters
resolution = 20_000  # grid cell size in meters

## make grid based on dataset bounds and resolution
gridx = np.arange(gpm25.bounds.minx.min(), gpm25.bounds.maxx.max(), resolution)
gridy = np.arange(gpm25.bounds.miny.min(), gpm25.bounds.maxy.max(), resolution)

## use salem to create a dataset with the grid.
krig_ds = salem.Grid(
    nxny=(len(gridx), len(gridy)),
    dxdy=(resolution, resolution),
    x0y0=(gpm25.bounds.minx.min(), gpm25.bounds.miny.min()),

# ### Variogram
# #### variogram overview
# - Graphical representation of spatial autocorrelation.
# - Shows a fundamental principle of geography: closer things are more alike than things farther apart
# - Its created by calculating the difference squared between the values of the paired locations
#   - paired locations are binned by the distance apart
# - An empirical model is fitted to the binned (paired locations) to describe the likeness of data at a distance.
# - Type of empirical models
#    - Circular
#    - Spherical
#    - Exponential
#    - Gaussian
#    - Linear
#  - The fitted model is applied in the interpolation process by forming (kriging) weights for the predicted areas.

# #### variogram parameters
# - Three parameters that define a variogram..
#     - sill: the total variance where the empirical model levels off,
#       -  is the sum of the nugget plus the sills of each nested structure.
#     - (effective) range: The distance after which data are no longer correlated.
#       -  About the distance where the variogram levels off to the sill.
#     - nugget: Related to the amount of short range variability in the data.
#        - Choose a value for the best fit with the first few empirical variogram points.
#        -  A nugget that's large relative to the sill is problematic and could indicate too much noise and not enough spatial correlation.


#### variogram statistics
# A good model should result in
#   - Q1 close to zero

#   - Q2 close to one
#   - cR as small as possible.
# TODO define above stats variables.

# %% [markdown]
# #### Our variogram parameters
#  PyKrige will optimze most parmters based on the defiend empirela mode and number of bins
#  - I tested several empirical models and bin sizes and found (for this case study) spherical and 15 bins to be the optimal based on the output statics.
# - NOTE the literature supports spherical for geospatial interpolation applications over other methods.
