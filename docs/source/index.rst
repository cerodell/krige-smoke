Overview

From esri:

 `Kriging <https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/2.8/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/how-kriging-works.htm#:~:text=Kriging%20is%20a%20multistep%20process,directional%20bias%20in%20the%20data.>`_ is an advanced geostatistical procedure that generates an estimated surface from a scattered set of points with z-values. Unlike other interpolation methods in the Interpolation toolset, to use the Kriging tool effectively involves an interactive investigation of the spatial behavior of the phenomenon represented by the z-values before you select the best estimation method for generating the output surface.
