    "# Ordinary Kriging (OK)\n",
    "Ordinary kriging (OK) is the most widely used kriging method. It is a linear unbiased estimators since error mean is equal to zero. In OK, local mean is filtered from the linear estimator by forcing the kriging weights to sum to 1. The OK is usually preferred to simple kriging because it requires neither knowledge nor stationarity of mean over the entire area\n",
