    "# Ordinary Kriging (OK)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ordinary Kriging (OK) is a commonly used geostatistical method.\n",
    "- OK provides the best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE), where the estimated value for the point of interest is a weighted linear combination of sampled observations (i.e., the sum of weights is 1) [Matheron1963](http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.58.8.1246).\n",
    "- OK is similar to but more advanced than Inverse distance weighting, as the weight ùúÜùëñ of OK is estimated by minimizing the variance of the prediction errors.\n",
    "  - This is achieved by constructing a semivariogram that models the difference between neighboring values.\n",
    "- Compared to non-geostatistical algorithms, the strength of ordinary kriging is its ability to model the spatial structure (variance) of the sampled observations.\n",
    "- An assumption of ordinary kriging is data stationarity. That is, the mean of the interpolated variable is constant within the search window, which is often not true. This makes OK unsuitable for interpolation over large domains and often requires data transformation.\n",
